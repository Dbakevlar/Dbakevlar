- 👋 Hi, I’m Kellyn Gorman, AKA @Dbakevlar
- I'm the Director of Technical Advocacy at Silk
- 💞️ I’m previously an SME for Oracle on Azure IaaS and worked at Microsoft in the CAE team for five years.

-Oracle is the "whale in the pond" in Azure.  Microsoft has 1000's of customers running Oracle in Azure on IaaS, but rarely is it discussed.  
-This repository has some of my work from the last four years I've worked at Microsoft in higher-Ed and CAE, but more is housed in the Microsoft 
-repository at Azure/Oracle-Workloads-for-Azure: Oracle workloads for Azure infrastructure as a service (Oracle Azure IaaS) (github.com)
